#TODO
* Target and obstacle collision detection
* Correct physics issues
    * Attempt to apply Schiffman's [Nature of Code algorithm](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces/)
    * Have lifecycle only last until gravity overtakes
* Controls to change properties dynamically, including obstacle location.
* Taller window
* Bonus for passing close?
* DNA as [emulated list type?](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#emulating-container-types)
