# python-smart-bubbles
This projects attempts to recreate Daniel Schiffman's JS coding exercise "smart rockets" (itself an implementation of
Jer Thorp's ActionScript version) using Python. It utilizes John Zelle's graphics.py to simplify on screen drawing,
and implements its own 2D Vector class.

It currently runs 1000 generations, moving targets and obstacles every 100.
